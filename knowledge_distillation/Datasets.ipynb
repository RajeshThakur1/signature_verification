It is also known as a socket wrench and is used in a variety of applications, from automotive repair to plumbing and electrical work. The ratchet wrench is designed to make it easier to turn fasteners in tight spaces where other tools may not fit. The ratchet works by locking into place when it is applied to the nut or bolt and then releasing when pressure is applied in the opposite direction. This allows you to quickly and easily loosen and tighten fasteners without having to constantly re-position your hand.\n",
